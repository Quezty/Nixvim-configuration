### This is my version of an already existing config of [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim). The config was taken from [this](https://github.com/ahwxorg/nixvim-config) repo.

## What each file in `/config` does

- `keymappings.nix`: Custom keybindings.
- `options.nix`: configuration options for standard nvim.
- `plugins.nix`: Enables plugins and their configuration.
- `default.nix`: Imports all files in the directory.
